# Consumer HTTP Endpoints JSON Formatting Update

## Overview
This update improves the readability of JSON responses from the consumer HTTP server endpoints by implementing proper indentation and adding descriptive fields.

## Changes Made

### 1. JSON Response Formatting
- **Added indented JSON output**: All endpoints now use `encoder.SetIndent("", "  ")` for 2-space indentation
- **Improved readability**: JSON responses are now properly formatted for human consumption
- **Maintained API compatibility**: All existing field names and structure remain unchanged

### 2. Enhanced Data Structures
Added descriptive fields to provide better context:

#### MemoryMetrics
- Added `Description` field: "Memory usage statistics in megabytes"

#### GCMetrics  
- Added `Description` field: "Garbage collection performance statistics"

#### OSMetrics
- Added `Description` field: "Operating system and architecture information"

#### ConsumerMetrics
- Added `StatusDescription` field with detailed status explanations:
  - "Consumer is running but has not processed any messages yet" (waiting)
  - "Consumer was active but no recent messages received" (idle)  
  - "Consumer is actively processing messages" (active)

### 3. Updated Endpoints

#### /health
- Returns properly formatted JSON with health status, version info, and checks
- Includes descriptive information about service state

#### /metrics  
- Returns comprehensive runtime metrics with readable formatting
- Memory, GC, OS, and consumer metrics all properly indented
- Enhanced with descriptive context for each metric category

#### /version
- Returns version information in readable JSON format
- Includes build details and service information

#### /ready
- Simple text response for Kubernetes readiness probes
- No changes needed for this endpoint

### 4. Implementation Details

```go
// All handlers now use this pattern for readable JSON output
w.Header().Set("Content-Type", "application/json")
encoder := json.NewEncoder(w)
encoder.SetIndent("", "  ")
encoder.Encode(response)
```

### 5. Example Output

Before (minified):
```json
{"status":"healthy","timestamp":"2025-07-13T11:30:03Z","version":"v1.0.0","checks":{"server":"healthy"}}
```

After (formatted):
```json
{
  "status": "healthy",
  "timestamp": "2025-07-13T11:30:03.61396-07:00",
  "version": "v1.0.0",
  "commit_hash": "abc123",
  "build_time": "2025-07-13T10:00:00Z",
  "uptime": "5m30s",
  "service_type": "kafka-consumer",
  "checks": {
    "consumer": "healthy",
    "server": "healthy"
  }
}
```

## Testing
- Created test script to verify JSON formatting
- Confirmed all endpoints return properly indented JSON
- Validated that description fields provide helpful context
- Ensured backward compatibility with existing clients

## Files Modified
- `internal/consumer/server/server.go`: Updated all handlers and data structures
- `scripts/demo-consumer-server.sh`: Updated to showcase JSON formatting

## Benefits
1. **Better Developer Experience**: Easier to read and debug API responses
2. **Enhanced Documentation**: Description fields provide context for metrics
3. **Improved Monitoring**: More detailed status descriptions for better observability
4. **Maintained Compatibility**: All existing integrations continue to work

The consumer HTTP server now provides a much better user experience with readable, well-formatted JSON responses while maintaining full API compatibility.
